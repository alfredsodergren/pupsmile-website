        <h2>I was sitting in a vet's parking lot staring at a $1,200 estimate.</h2>
        <p>Not for surgery. Not for an emergency. For a <em>dental cleaning.</em></p>
        <p>My dog Charlie had been going to the same vet for seven years. I trusted them. But the quote kept climbing — blood work "just in case," anesthesia monitoring, "anything we find while we're in there." By the end of the call I felt like I'd walked into a used car dealership. And then I felt guilty about it.</p>
        <p>I went home and spent three weeks in research mode. I read the studies. I talked to an independent vet. And I found what I'd been missing: <strong>daily prevention is what actually works.</strong> Bacteria that cause dental disease build up every single day. A once-a-year cleaning doesn't stop that — daily maintenance does.</p>
        <p>I found the science behind postbiotic enzyme formulas, worked with a formulator, and built PupSmile. One serving on Charlie's food every morning. His vet hasn't mentioned his teeth in two years.</p>
        <p>That's all I wanted. For other dog owners to have the option I almost never found.</p>

            <p>Took this photo at the 6-week mark. My GSD Ranger had the worst tartar buildup — vet kept saying we needed a cleaning. Look at those teeth now. No cleaning needed.</p>

          <p>I was skeptical going in. My dog is a 6-year-old French Bulldog — Frenchies are notoriously bad with dental health. Vet said at age 3 we'd need cleanings every year at around $900 each. I tried everything. He'd spit out the toothpaste, ignore the chews. Started adding this to his kibble quietly. At his checkup a few months later the vet said his teeth looked 'surprisingly clean for a Frenchie.' Unprompted. I hadn't mentioned changing anything. I nearly cried. After years of guilt and expensive quotes, that meant everything.</p>

            <p>Small breeds get the worst dental problems and the most expensive bills. Milo is a 6-year-old mini mix and I was dreading his next cleaning quote. PupSmile has made such a difference. He loves mealtime and has no idea it's doing him good.</p>

          <p>Honest review for other senior dog owners: my Lab mix is 10. Vet quoted $1,400 and mentioned possible extractions. I was worried about anesthesia at his age so I tried this first. Month one: breath noticeably better. Month two: tartar starting to break up near the gumline. I'm not saying it fixes everything — he may still need work eventually — but it's clearly slowing the progression. That matters a lot at age 10.</p>

          <p>I spent $800 on a dental cleaning that didn't even last 6 months. Then I saw a post about PupSmile and figured it was worth a shot. Nine days in and her teeth and breath are already better than right after the cleaning. Kind of mad I wasted the $800 — but at least I know what to do from here.</p>

          <p>I'd been using a different dental powder for two years — minimal results. Switched to PupSmile based on a friend's recommendation. The difference was noticeable within two weeks. I don't know what they put in it but it works in a way the other stuff didn't.</p>

          <p>I'm retired and on a fixed income. A $1,200 vet dental bill isn't something I can just absorb. PupSmile is something I actually can afford every month. And it works. My 9-year-old mutt Rocky has better breath and cleaner teeth than he has in years.</p>

          <p>I was convinced this was overpriced green dust. Three months later my vet said — without any prompting — that my dog's teeth had improved since the last visit. Okay. Fine. It works. I'm annoyed I doubted it.</p>

          <p>Took closer to 5–6 weeks before I really noticed a difference — longer than I expected. But once I did, it was clear. His teeth are definitely cleaner. Just set realistic expectations on the timeline.</p>

          <p>My dog inhales her food in about 8 seconds so I'm honestly not sure how much powder she actually absorbs. Breath improved a bit but I haven't seen much tartar change at 3 weeks. Probably works better for dogs that actually chew.</p>

          <p>Vet said we'd need a cleaning by end of year. We started PupSmile instead. Six months later at the checkup she asked what we'd changed. No cleaning needed. Still kind of amazed.</p>

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

      <div class="faq-list">

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can this replace a professional vet cleaning?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Not entirely — and we won't claim otherwise. PupSmile is daily maintenance that prevents plaque from escalating to the point where a cleaning becomes urgent. Many customers report that at their dog's next annual checkup, the vet didn't bring up dental cleaning at all, or pushed the timeline out significantly. The goal isn't "never see a vet" — it's "not today, not yet."</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How long before I see results?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Fresher breath: most owners notice within 5–10 days. Visibly cleaner teeth: expect 3–6 weeks of daily use. Existing hardened tartar takes longer to address. Use it every day and you'll see it compound over time.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>My dog is a senior — is it safe?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Yes. PupSmile uses natural, food-safe ingredients formulated for dogs of all ages. For senior dogs especially — where general anesthesia carries real risk — a daily food-based powder is often the most responsible option available.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Will my dog notice it in their food?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>PupSmile is virtually odorless and tasteless — designed to be completely undetectable in food. The vast majority of dogs eat normally with zero hesitation. If yours is particularly sensitive, start with half a serving for the first few days.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item" id="auto-delivery-faq">
          <summary>Why is it only available as a monthly subscription?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Because dental health is a daily habit, not a one-time fix. Bacteria that cause plaque build up every single day — a product you use once or twice won't change that. PupSmile works through consistent daily use, and the results compound over weeks and months. A monthly subscription means your dog never has a gap in their routine. You can pause or cancel anytime by contacting us before your next shipment date.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is the Clean Smile Guarantee?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Simple: try PupSmile for 30 days. If you're not happy with your dog's results, contact our support and we'll take care of you. We're a small brand — every customer matters to us, and we stand behind our product.</p>
          </div>
        </details>

        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How is PupSmile different from other dental powders?</summary>
          <div class="faq-body">
            <p>Most dental powders use seaweed-derived ingredients that work on the surface level. PupSmile's postbiotic enzyme formula actively targets the bacterial biofilm that causes both bad breath and plaque buildup. Full ingredient transparency — no proprietary blends hiding what's actually in it.</p>
