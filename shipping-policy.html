        <p class="legal-intro">PupSmile partners with major international shipping companies like FedEx, SF Express, DHL, UPS, and EMS who work with local couriers — allowing us to ship direct to your door and proudly offer flat rate worldwide shipping.</p>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Payment &amp; Order Verification</h2>
          <p>You will be charged when your order is placed. All payments are subject to verification and approval before shipping and may take several days to process. To help fight credit card fraud, orders with incorrect billing information or requiring additional verification may be delayed and/or cancelled.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Shipping Process</h2>
          <p>We require between <strong>2–5 working days</strong> on average to fulfill your order and transport it to our carrier's sort facility. Some items may take longer especially around major holidays (up to 10 days), or if your order includes popular items experiencing stock availability issues.</p>
          <p>Once your order has begun processing through our shipping department we are unable to make any changes (including address changes). We will only ship to the address provided at check-out.</p>
          <p>We only ship during business days and do not ship on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. Once your order has shipped, you will receive a Shipping Confirmation email.</p>
          <p>For orders with multiple items, products may be shipped separately and received on different dates due to the difference in manufacturing partners' locations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Order Tracking</h2>
          <p>All orders are processed with tracking numbers. You will receive an email with the tracking number when your order is dispatched to the carrier's sort facility.</p>
          <p>For some shipping companies, it can take <strong>several days for the tracking information to update</strong> in the system. If your order was placed more than 5 business days ago and there is still no information on your tracking number, please contact us at <a href="mailto:pupsmileco@gmail.com">pupsmileco@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Estimated Delivery Times</h2>
          <p>Shipping time varies by country or region. Specific delivery dates are not provided nor guaranteed. These are our estimates for reference:</p>
          <table class="shipping-table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Location</th>
                <th>Estimated Shipping Time*</th>
              </tr>

          <p><em>*The days listed above are only estimates in business/working days and do not include our 2–5 day processing time.</em></p>
          <p>While we will do all that we can to make sure your order is delivered on time, PupSmile cannot be held responsible for conditions beyond our control such as required postal or customs clearance procedures, holidays, severe weather, labor disputes, protests, etc. and these interruptions can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Duties, Taxes, and Other Fees</h2>
          <p>International shipments may be subject to import taxes, duties and/or customs clearance fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. These fees are the sole responsibility of the recipient. PupSmile has no control over these charges, nor can PupSmile predict what they may be.</p>
          <p>If a shipment is refused and returned, you will be responsible for any import taxes and return shipping costs incurred.</p>
          <p>Customs policies vary widely by country. If you have questions we recommend that you contact your local customs office for more information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Lost, Stolen or Damaged Packages</h2>
          <p>PupSmile is not responsible for lost, stolen or damaged packages. If your tracking information states that your package was delivered to your address and you have not received it, please report it and/or file a claim with your respective shipping carrier.</p>
          <p>We utilize the timestamp information from the tracking link and delivery confirmation from the carrier when reviewing damage or return requests and we may not be able to honor your claim if it is not reported promptly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Wrong Address Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>It is the responsibility of the buyer to make sure that the shipping address entered is correct before submitting an order. We start working on your order immediately, so we are unable to make any changes to an order after it has been placed. If the order has already been processed through our shipping department, we cannot retrieve it for an address change.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
          <h2>Contact &amp; Feedback</h2>
          <p>We would love to hear your feedback, questions, or any concerns. Please feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:pupsmileco@gmail.com">pupsmileco@gmail.com</a>. We take your feedback very seriously and are always striving to improve.</p>
